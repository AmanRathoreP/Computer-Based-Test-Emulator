# Facts
* The project was commenced by Aman Rathore (GitHub: [@Aman](https://www.github.com/AmanRathoreP)) in February 2024, following the completion of their JEE Mains Session 1 exam. Its primary objective is to facilitate practice for exam-style questions within an environment akin to that of an exam hall.
* CBT-Emulator is not designed with the intention of catering to a broad user demographic. Its singular focus lies in acclimatizing users to the examination environment specific to assessments such as JEE, IAT, NEST, and similar examinations.
